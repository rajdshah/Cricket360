This repository houses the comprehensive code and files related to my Cricket Data Analytics Project. The central objective of this project was to collect, refine, analyze, and visually represent cricket-related data, culminating in the creation of an engaging and interactive dashboard. The project journey unfolds through distinct phases, encompassing web scraping to gather data, meticulous preprocessing, sophisticated data modeling, and finally, the artistic design and implementation of a dynamic dashboard using Power BI.

**Key Step**
- **Data Collection:** Utilized Bright Data web scraper to extract match details and player statistics from ESPN Cricinfo, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

- **Data Transformation:** Employed Python and Pandas to convert raw JSON data into CSV format, enhancing data accessibility and compatibility for subsequent processing.

- **Powerful Visualization:** Leveraged Power BI's dynamic dashboards, integrating interactive charts and visualizations, providing deep insights into player performance and team dynamics.

- **Informed Decision-Making:** Applied data-driven analysis to carefully select the best playing 11, optimizing team composition based on performance metrics and strategic insights.

- **Holistic Approach:** Merged web scraping, Python scripting, and Power BI visualization, creating a seamless workflow that transformed raw data into actionable insights for the cricket team selection.

- **Strategic Technological Utilization:** Integrated advanced technologies such as Bright Data, Python, Pandas, and Power BI, synergizing their capabilities to enhance the decision-making process and maximize the team's chances of victory.
